## **Guide for Managing Load Balancer Rules**

### **Step 1: Generate the Excel Sheet**

**1.1. Run the Script `Getlb.py`**

- **Objective**: To generate an Excel sheet containing the necessary information for creating load balancer rules.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
     ```bash
     pip install boto3 openpyxl
     ```
  2. Execute the script:
     ```bash
     python Getlb.py
     ```
  3. The script will generate an Excel sheet named `loadbalancer_rules.xlsx` in your working directory.

**1.2. Modify the Domain Name**

- **Objective**: To update the domain names in the generated Excel sheet to match your requirements.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Open the `loadbalancer_rules.xlsx` file in Excel or any spreadsheet application.
  2. Locate the column containing domain names or any relevant data you need to change.
  3. Update the domain names as required.
  4. Save the changes to the Excel file.

### **Step 2: Create Load Balancer Rules**

**2.1. Run the Script `Createlb.py`**

- **Objective**: To create load balancer rules based on the updated Excel sheet.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
     ```bash
     pip install boto3 openpyxl
     ```
  2. **Modify the Script**:
     - **Load Balancer ARN**: Change the `LOAD_BALANCER_ARN` variable to the ARN of your desired load balancer.
     - **Target Group Names**: Ensure that the target group names in the Excel file match those in your destination account.
  3. Execute the script:
     ```bash
     python Createlb.py
     ```

**Note**: The script will process the updated Excel sheet and create load balancer rules accordingly. Ensure that your AWS credentials have sufficient permissions to perform these operations.

### **Script Details**

**`Getlb.py`**:
- **Purpose**: Retrieves information about load balancers and generates an Excel sheet.
- **Output**: `loadbalancer_rules.xlsx`

**`Createlb.py`**:
- **Purpose**: Reads the Excel sheet and creates load balancer rules based on the provided data.
- **Instructions**: Make sure to update the `LOAD_BALANCER_ARN` and verify target group names before running.
